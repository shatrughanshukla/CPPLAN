Why Do We Need Constructors?
Constructors in C++ are special member functions that are automatically called when an object of a class is created. Their primary purpose is to initialize objects to a valid state. Constructors help set initial values for member variables, allocate resources, or perform other setup tasks that an object needs to function correctly.

When to Use Constructors?

Initializing Variables: If an object requires specific initial values for its data members.
Resource Allocation: If the object manages external resources like files, memory, or network connections, constructors can allocate and prepare these resources.
Preventing Uninitialized Data: They ensure that objects donâ€™t start with garbage values by providing meaningful default or user-defined initial values.

Types of Constructors:
Default Constructor: A constructor with no parameters.
Parameterized Constructor: A constructor that takes arguments to initialize an object with specific values.
Copy Constructor: Initializes a new object as a copy of an existing object.

When we use it++ (postfix increment) in a loop, it does two things:

It creates a temporary copy of it before incrementing.
It then increments the original it and discards the temporary copy, but this detail is generally optimized away by the compiler in simple loops.
Here’s how this works step-by-step:

First Iteration (it = d.begin()):

it++ creates a temporary copy of it at its current position (d[0] or 1).
We access the current element (1) via this copy.
Then, it (the original iterator) is incremented to point to the next position (d[1], or 2), and the copy is discarded.
Second Iteration (it now points to d[1]):

it++ creates a temporary copy of it at d[1] (2).
We access 2 through the copy.
Then, the original it increments to d[2] (or 3), discarding the copy.
Third Iteration (it now points to d[2]):

it++ creates a temporary copy at d[2] (which is 3).
We access 3 through this copy.
Finally, it increments past the last element to d.end(), ending the loop.
In a typical loop, this temporary copy does not affect the outcome. But in complex code, it can have side effects if that temporary is used in assignments or function calls.


// so that means in the loop when we access d.begin(), we're actually accesing the copy of d[0] and after tht at it++, the original one is incremented and copy is discarded?

Yes, exactly! When you use `it++` in the loop, you're accessing the value of the current element in the container (like `deque`) through a temporary copy of the iterator. Here’s a clearer breakdown of what happens during each iteration:

1. **Accessing the Current Element**:
   - When you access `*it`, you're accessing the value at the position that `it` currently points to. If `it` is pointing to `d[0]`, you are accessing the value of `d[0]`.
   - However, before `it` is incremented, a temporary copy of `it` is made, allowing you to get the current value.

2. **Incrementing the Original Iterator**:
   - After you access the value, the `it++` operation increments the original iterator `it` to point to the next element in the container. 
   - The temporary copy of `it` is discarded after this operation.

So in each iteration of the loop, you're effectively getting the current element’s value before moving to the next one, which is how you can traverse the entire container. 

### Example Recap:

Given this loop for a `deque`:

```cpp
for (auto it = d.begin(); it != d.end(); ++it) {
    cout << *it << " "; // Accessing the current value
}
```

- **First Iteration**:
  - `it` points to `d[0]`, access `*it` gives you the first element.
  - After accessing, `it` is incremented to point to `d[1]`.

- **Second Iteration**:
  - Now `it` points to `d[1]`, access `*it` gives you the second element.
  - After accessing, `it` is incremented to point to `d[2]`.

This continues until `it` points past the last element, at which point the loop stops. So yes, you're right in understanding that you are accessing the element value through a temporary copy while the original iterator is incremented.

for (auto it = d.begin(); it != d.end(); ++it) {
        cout << *it << " ";
    }

When we use ++it in a loop, it works a bit differently from it++. Here's how it functions step-by-step:

Initialization:

it starts at d.begin(), pointing to d[0] (value 1).

Incrementing the Iterator:

The prefix increment ++it increments the original iterator it first, moving it to the next position in the container.

Accessing the Current Element:

After the increment, when you access *it, it points to the next element in the container.
Detailed Step-by-Step Example:
Let’s break down how ++it works in a loop:

First Iteration (it = d.begin()):

++it increments it to point to the next element (from d[0] or 1 to d[1] or 2).
Now, when we access *it, we get the value at d[1] (which is 2).
Second Iteration (it now points to d[1]):

++it increments it to point to d[2] (or 3).
Now, *it gives us the value at d[2] (which is 3).
Third Iteration (it now points to d[2]):

++it increments it to point to d[3] (or 4 if present).
If there’s no d[3], it would point to d.end(), ending the loop.
Key Differences from it++:
No Temporary Copy: With ++it, there’s no temporary copy created. The original iterator is incremented, and you immediately get the new value when you dereference it.

Efficiency: In terms of performance, ++it can be more efficient than it++ because it avoids the overhead of creating a temporary copy, especially for complex iterators (like those of a linked list).

Conclusion:
In typical usage, the difference may not impact the outcome in simple loops. However, using ++it ensures that you're working with the most current element directly, while it++ gives you the current element before moving to the next one. Understanding these nuances helps in choosing the right form based on context and performance considerations.

/*
Inline Functions in C++
Inline functions are used to reduce the function call.
When one function is being called multiple times in the program it increases the execution time, so inline function is used to reduce time and increase program efficiency.
If the inline function is being used when the function is called, the inline function expands the whole function code at the point of a function call, instead of running the function. Inline functions are considered to be used when the function is small otherwise it will not perform well.
Inline is not recommended when static variables are being used in the function.

The main thing to note here is that the function will not run instead of it the function code will be copied at the place where the function is being called.
This will increase the execution time of the program because the compiler doesnâ€™t have to copy the values and get the return value again and again from the compiler.

using namespace std;

inline int product(int a, int b){
    // Not recommended to use below lines with inline functions
    // static int c=0; // This executes only once
    // c = c + 1; // Next time this function is run, the value of c will be retained
    return a*b;
}
